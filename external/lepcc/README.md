# LEPCC - Limited Error Point Cloud Compression

Based on LERC (see https://github.com/Esri/lerc)

This repository contains a 3D point cloud compression module written in C++. It has a C API, and a test program. For the C API, see src/include/lepcc_c_api.h. For the test program that uses the C API, see src/Test_C_Api.cpp. 


## Features

* Compression of 3D point cloud tiles.

* Caller specifies max error or tolerance for each x, y, and z.

* Compression ~10x for (x, y, z) for 1 cm accuracy. (On the datasets we have tested so far. It is data dependent.)

* Compression ~3x for RGB (if points come with color). Colors are clustered in RGB space and then quantized to 8 bit. 
  The 8 bit color indexes can get Huffman encoded. 

* Compression 1-2x for Las intensity, lossless. Better than gzip. Detect upscale factor if any, revert it, bit stuff. 

* Compression for Las return, class, or other flag bytes, lossless. Tries Huffman and bit stuff, takes the better. 

* Encoding speed ~1 ms per tile (for geometry).

* Encoding speed ~2 ms per tile (for geometry + color).

* Decoding speed ~1/4 ms per tile.

* Good for streaming.

* Shares low level code with Lerc raster compression.

* Has the other advantages of Lerc: No dependencies on other libraries or packages, 
  easy to port the decoder to other languages such as JS, Python, C# etc.
